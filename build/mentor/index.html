            <h2>Help fix tech</h2>
            <p>The Collab Lab is on a mission to fix tech, an industry rife with gatekeeping and inequity. <a href="/about-us/#participants">Our participants</a> reflect the diversity we want to see in tech, with an emphasis on supporting people from groups typically under-represented on software teams. Joining us as a mentor is a way to give back and help early career developers gain their footholds in tech.</p>

            <h2>What it entails</h2>

                <img src="/assets/img/tcl-7-call.jpg" alt="Collab Lab mentors and participants taking part in one of our weekly check-in calls">
                <figcaption>Cohort 7 and mentors taking part in a weekly check-in call</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The time expectation for mentors is the same as for our participants: <strong>5 hours per week.</strong> We intentionally structure the program this way to reduce barriers to participation.</p>
            <p>As a mentor, your job is to work with your fellow mentors (typically 3 mentors per cohort) to help our participants learn how to collaborate on a software team. In a typical week, this may involve the following activities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Helping your pair understand the acceptance criteria for their issue for the week</li>
                <li>Answering questions on Slack during the week (and occasionally jumping on a Zoom call) to keep your group unblocked</li>
                <li>Reviewing your pairâ€™s PR</li>
                <li>Attending your teamâ€™s weekly sync call where they demo their work</li>
                <li>Presenting a 15-minute learning module on a topic such as how to even code review or how to more effectively pair program (if that sounds intimidating, donâ€™t worry, we have materials you can use as inspiration!)</li>
                <li>Always, always, always boosting your team on Slack (the more GIFs and emoji the better!) ðŸŽ‰</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Qualifications</h2>
            <p><a href="/about-us/#mentors">Our mentors</a> are professional web developers and engineering leaders. We want you to be able to speak to your team from your experience in the trenches of software development. But that doesnâ€™t mean you canâ€™t contribute if youâ€™re still early in your career! Successful Collab Lab mentors have ranged from 2 to 20+ years of experience in the industry.</p>
            <p>Our projects are based in the React JavaScript framework. Experience with React is helpful, but not a hard requirement. Weâ€™ve had mentors learn alongside their teams and that can make for a really nice dynamic where you model how to improve your skills!</p>
            <h2>Apply</h2>
            <p>We kick off a new pair of cohorts every 9 weeks, so itâ€™s always a good time to let us know youâ€™re interested in helping out!</p>
            <blockquote>
