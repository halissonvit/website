            <p>The Collab Lab exists to help early career developers gain their footholds in tech. Our participants are all early career developers, many of them veterans of coding bootcamps or self-study, some of them a year or two into their tech careers.</p>
            <p>We donâ€™t teach coding, so you need to already have a baseline of skills to get in, but what you gain from Collab Lab is experience working on a software team, led by people in the industry, on a project structured in a way very close to what youâ€™d see at many companies.</p>
            <h2>How to apply</h2>
            <p>Our next two cohorts will kick off on <strong>August 2, 2020.</strong> The application window will be open from <strong>July 5 â€“ 11.</strong> We will notify you of your status the following week.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Return to this page between July 5 & 11 to submit your application.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>If youâ€™d like us to remind you by email that the application window is opening, submit your email address below.</p>
            
            <h2>Get ready!</h2>
            <p>We hope our application form isnâ€™t too onerous, but to help you prepare in advance for when the application window opens here are the questions weâ€™ll be asking you to answer:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Name</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Pronouns â€“</strong> Your identity is important to us.</li>
                <li><strong>Time zone â€“</strong> Our cohorts so far have all operated in North American time zones. We hope to run a Europe/Africa cohort towards the end of 2020.</li>
                <li><strong>Do you agree to abide by <a href="/code-of-conduct/">The Collab Lab Code of Conduct</a>? â€“</strong> This is non-negotiable. If you want in, you need to play by the rules.</li>
                <li><strong>Link to a code repository (e.g., GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc.) or other example of your work â€“</strong> Point us to whatever work of your best represents your skills in JavaScript generally and React in particular.</li>
                <li><strong>What makes you interested in The Collab Lab? â€“</strong> We take this question seriously because we want to form teams that are going to support and be open to learning from each other.</li>
                <li><strong>What have you done to learn coding so far? â€“</strong> There is no right or wrong answer to this one. Just help us get to know you by telling us about your coding journey!</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>What happens after I apply?</h2>
            <p>Not surprisingly, youâ€™ll fall into one of the following categories:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>ðŸ¤— You get accepted. Yay! Weâ€™ll be in touch with next steps.</li>
                <li>ðŸ˜¥ You get rejected. For nowâ€¦try again!</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>We anticipate more applicants than we will have slots.</strong> If youâ€™re qualified, but the numbers just didnâ€™t work out, weâ€™ll let you know that and you can totally apply the next time using the same info. If, on the other hand, we evaluated your experience and determined you didnâ€™t meet the minimum requirements in some way, weâ€™ll let you know that, too. That way you can put in the work to increase your chances of being accepted before the next application window opens.</p>
            <p>So, yes, <strong>you may have to apply multiple times</strong> in order to be selected. The good news is, youâ€™ll know where you stand!</p>
