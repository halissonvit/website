                <li>A place to work alongside your peers</li>
                <li>An opportunity to learn from experienced developers</li>

                <q>Collab Lab gave me agile team experience I didn’t get through my coding bootcamp. I honestly don’t think I would have landed that first job offer without being able to talk about my experience with pair programming and resolving merge conflicts. Beyond that, I made some great friends!</q>
