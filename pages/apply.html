<p>
  The Collab Lab exists to help early-career developers gain their footholds in
  tech. Our participants are all early-career developers, many of them veterans
  of coding bootcamps or self-study, some of them a year or two into their tech
  careers.
</p>
<p>
  We don‚Äôt teach coding, so you need to already have a baseline of skills to get
  in, but what you gain from Collab Lab is experience working on a software
  team, led by people in the industry, on a project structured in a way very
  close to what you‚Äôd see at many companies.
</p>

<!-- Comment out the next line when applications are OPEN -->
<p>
  Our next cohort will kick off on <strong>January 3, 2021.</strong> The

</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
  If you‚Äôd like us to remind you by email that the application window is
  opening,
  <a
    href="http://eepurl.com/g7Zgj5"
    target="sign-up-form"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    onclick="window.open(this.href, 'sign-up-form', 'width=675,height=675');return false;"
    >submit your email address on this form</a
  >
  (will open in a new window).
</p>
<h2>Get ready!</h2>
<p>Here are the questions we‚Äôll be asking you to answer:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Name</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Pronouns ‚Äì</strong> Your identity is important to us.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Region ‚Äì</strong> In October, we will run teams in North America,
    Latin America (Spanish speakers only), and Europe/Africa.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Time zone ‚Äì</strong> For October 2020, we will run teams based in
    North & South American and European/African time zones. üåéüåçüåè
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Do you agree to abide by The Collab Lab Code of Conduct? ‚Äì</strong>
    This is non-negotiable. If you want to participate, you must agree to follow
    the Code of Conduct.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong
      >Link to a code repository (e.g., GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc.) or
      other example of your work ‚Äì</strong
    >
    We use GitHub to host our projects, but mostly this question is about seeing
    examples of your work so feel free to point us to anything that represents
    you well. Your best bet is to link directly to a React project. Thanks!
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>What do you hope to learn from participating in The Collab Lab? ‚Äì</strong> We take this
    question seriously because we want to form teams that are going to support
    and be open to learning from each other. We are interested in your
    motivations and aspirations, so help us get to know you!
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>What have you done to learn coding so far? ‚Äì</strong> It‚Äôs super
    helpful for us to understand your coding journey. There is no right or wrong
    answer to this one!
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>What happens after I apply?</h2>
<p>Not surprisingly, you‚Äôll fall into one of the following categories:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    ü§ó <strong>You get accepted.</strong> Yay! We‚Äôll be in touch with next
    steps.
  </li>
  <li>üò• <strong>You get rejected.</strong> For now‚Ä¶try again!</li>
</ol>
<p>
  <strong>We anticipate more applicants than we will have slots.</strong>
  If you‚Äôre qualified, but the numbers just didn‚Äôt work out, we‚Äôll let you know
  that and you can totally apply the next time using the same info. If, on the
  other hand, we evaluated your experience and determined you didn‚Äôt meet the
  minimum requirements in some way, we‚Äôll let you know that, too. That way you
  can put in the work to increase your chances of being accepted before the next
  application window opens.
</p>
<p>
  So, yes, <strong>you may have to apply multiple times</strong> in order to be
  selected. The good news is, you‚Äôll know where you stand!
</p>
<h2>Have questions?</h2>

  If you have any questions about the application process or what it‚Äôs like to
  participate in a Collab Lab cohort, please don‚Äôt hesitate to email
