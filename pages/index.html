            <blockquote>
                <q>Collab Lab gave me agile team experience I didn’t get through my coding bootcamp. I honestly don’t think I would have landed that first job offer without being able to talk about my experience with pair programming and resolving merge conflicts. Beyond that, I made some great friends!</q>

We don’t teach coding; we teach collaboration! You don’t need a ton of experience, but <strong>you should have completed the equivalent of a coding bootcamp</strong> where you’ve learned (at a minimum) basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and have completed a project or two in <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>.</p>
