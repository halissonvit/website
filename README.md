# Website V2

- This project uses [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator like Gatsby or Next.js, but it's a lot simpler and doesn't have a dependency on React.

## Scripts to run the project

```
npm run dev # starts the dev server in por 8080
npm run build # builds the site and outputs it in the /_site/ folder
```
