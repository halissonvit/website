# The Collab Lab Code of Conduct

The Collab Lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all Collab Lab spaces, including but not limited to our GitHub and Slack teams, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the RESPONSE TEAM.

Some Collab Lab spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

Harassment includes:

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
- Deliberate misgendering or use of “dead” or rejected names.
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour  in spaces where they’re not appropriate.
- Physical contact and simulated physical contact (e.g., textual descriptions such as “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.
- Threats of violence.
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
- Deliberate intimidation.
- Stalking or following.
- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
- Sustained disruption of discussion.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
- Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
- Publication of non-harassing private communication.
The Collab Lab prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. RESPONSE TEAM reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding:
- “Reverse”-isms, including “reverse racism,” “reverse sexism,” and “cisphobia”

## Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of The Collab Lab, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the RESPONSE TEAM immediately. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.

This code of conduct applies to Collab Lab spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of The Collab Lab outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Collab Lab members, especially Founder Andrew Hedges, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from The Collab Lab based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Collab Lab spaces and behavior towards people who are not in The Collab Lab.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Collab Lab members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

You can report violations in the following ways:

- Email Stacie Taylor-Cima, Lisa Smith, and Michelle Sauque at [code-of-conduct@the-collab-lab.codes](mailto:code-of-conduct@the-collab-lab.codes)
- Direct message @stacie, @Lisa Smith and/or @Michelle Sauque in the Collab Lab Slack workspace

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, RESPONSE TEAM may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Collab Lab spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Collab Lab members or the general public.
